2. Set up Next.js app (https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation )
   3.Added routes + .tsx files for individual pages (Home, Story, Menu, Our Updates, Contact) from the template
3. Use built-in capabilities:

- Code splitting (routing and <Link> components for menu)
  (aditionally moved navbar and footer to `layout.tsx` to prevent mentioning each time)
